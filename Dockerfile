## NOTES ##
## Delete files\folders not needed, e.g. if you dont run any cron commands, delete the cron folder and the "ADD cron/ /etc/cron.d/" line. 
## The User abc, should be running everything, give that permission in any case you need it. 
## Use linuxserver/baseimage as often as posible (or linuxserver/baseimage.nginx where applicable)
## When creating init's Use 10's where posible, its to allow add stuff in between when needed. also, do not be afraid to split custom code into several little ones. 
## Make stuff as quiet as posible "e.g. apt-get update -qq" (Does not apply to the "app" itself. e.g. plex)
## user abc and folders /app /config /defaults are all created by baseimage
